# TreeGenerator
###### by Prizzledev



### Example Output:
```
my_app/
├─ .gitignore
├─ README.md
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.go
│  ├─ types.go
```

### How to use:

Copy the executable in the folder you want to get generated and run it. It will print out the generated tree.

### Inportant:

Folders that start with `.` (eg. `.git`) and the runnig executable wont be printed in the tree.
